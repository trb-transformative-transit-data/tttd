# Monthly Subcommittee Update - August 2024

Hello everyone! It's been a while since we met up in person during the annual meeting in January, and tomorrow we'll be kicking off the first of a monthly virtual call to continue the work and loop in folks who couldn't make the in-person meeting.

The call will be at 1pm eastern / 10am pacific on Friday, August 2 [register here](https://bit.ly/transit-data-infra-monthly)

During these calls we will discuss emerging needs, opportunities, and volunteer tasks to support the subcommittee's mission to help bridge the gap on a practical level between cutting-edge data infrastructure and governance practices and where transit agencies large and small are today.

## Volunteer Tasks

We'll discuss and flesh out more potential subcommittee tasks during the call, but some immediate needs include:

* Recruit and coordinate agencies to present show-and-tell sessions on their current or envisioned data infrastructure
* Review and edit RNS and associated survey questions
* Conduct interviews with agency staff
* Synthesize interview findings into report

### APTATech in Philly next week

* Data nerds will be attending the 4pm Technology Standards Policy and Planning Committee meeting on Sunday and convening afterwards to make plans for a hangout
* Shoot me an email if you want to be in the loop on any data nerd hangout we plan: [chris@jarv.us](mailto:chris@jarv.us)

### APTA Revenue and Data Working Group (RDWG) is setting up a Data Governance subgroup

* APTA could be a good second front for advancing our work and we'll discuss how to get involved

### Research Needs Statement (RNS) Draft Available

* [First draft of our RNS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ie16IvezMyMh-OGuBmZH6KpD4e4w2lM91GTDriW4Fuc/edit?usp=sharing) is available for review and comment
* Goal is to capture a broad sense of the current state of transit agency data infrastructure and governance
* This RNS will drive immediate work done by the committee's volunteers rather than be submitted for funding
* Will include two research components: A broadly distributed survey, and then interviews with selected agency staff
* We'll leverage this to build participation in the subcommittee
