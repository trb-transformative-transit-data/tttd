## Breakout group readouts

### Group 1

- 5/6 participants were consultants
- Challenges
  - Start assessing data holding when it's split between teams
  - It's tough to even start because we need to find the one person who ran the script before
  - Older systems - tougher to get stuff out of it, is part of the landscape
    - advocate for new systems when the old ones have so much inertia
  - Getting people to agree what is governance
  - Vendor proprietary data
- What can help
  - knowledge transfer
  - how do systems work? Especially systems that are procured.
  - having a broader understanding can build better RFP's
  - help surface and coordinate efforts and avoid duplications
  - touchpoints with adjacent communities
- What subcommittee can do
  - Coordinate adjacent communities at TRB, other things - adjacent community

### Group 2

- Challenges
  - No strategy on how to use data, where the data is (limited staff time)
  - Putting out guidances and best practices, even in the absence of a chief data officer
    - Good RNS statement for a synthesis
  - Documentation, version control
    - Doesn't live with that single person, or leave with them
    - Who knows "the guy/gal"
  - Leveraging staff interest - sharing that outside of their own team

### Group 3

- Challenges
  - Separate groups involved in data (IS, Operations, analysts)
    - Department's that manage data != use the data != create the data
  - Split in both groups and infrastructure
    - enterprise wide vs nimble infrastructure
  - Lack of expertise with smaller organizations
- What subcommittee can do
  - Best practices - documents, templates
  - how to move a technical need -> Executive level -> guidance
  - Staff roles, structures, need, skills
  - Open standards facilitate governance
  - data governance peer reviews - operations and maintenance is common, but not IT/ data

### Group 4

- Challenges
  - Data capacity issues - value of data - how to maintain it -
  - Using the data downstream from operations - the quality of the data
  - Infrastructure, but no policy in place to sustain that infrastructure
  - How do you get a culture where data is a priority at large and small agencies
  - Good governance, but how do we create a legacy
  - Find the benefit of open source / quality data - institutionalize it
  - knowledge transfer, but more sustainably
  - Data compliance matters

### Group 5

- 2 consultant / 2 small-mid agencies
- Challenges
  - IT is support, but people are building on their own
  - Procurement - one off projects, but not a long term program
  - Staff learning criteria
    - level of understanding from analysis -> IT
  - Data compilation - what/where is the data
  - Capital budget is useful for one off, but not long term ongoing staff to support data management
  - putting out fires / data to data vs long term mission
  - what are the sequential steps from here to a better future
- Things to share
  - when you standardize... it's much easier to have a conversation... but you need the data background
  - Tech procurement support - in the beginning they meet standards - its easier rather than doing it ex-post
  - visualize data vs just a data dump
  - give people control and to play the data
- What subcommittee can do
  - Standard language for procurements - so agencies can use directly
  - Same with Vendors
  - Understand the standards - discoverability of standards
  - Teaching agencies that are less familiar - osmosis between data infrastructure and transit domain knowledge

### Group 6

- Challenges
  - System decentralization - use "whatever someone else built" that lead to data quality/ conflicts
  - Accurate, complete, immutable, understandable
  - Governing GTFS
  - Divide between operators and analysts ( bridging the divide)
- What subcommittee can do
  - Best practices, definitions, buzzwords -> understandability
  - Federal gov and spreading knowledge
  - data governance at different sized agencies - spreadsheets are okay
  - Device to decision
  - Show how the data was really important in the decision process

## Potential subcommittee next steps

- Data infrastructure show / tell
- How to communicate
- Liason-ing with committees
- Growing the need with adjacent organizations
- keeping up / stay connected
- Slack to Newsletter data
