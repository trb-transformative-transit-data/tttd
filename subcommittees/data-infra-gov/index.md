# Data Infrastructure & Governance Subcommittee

[Â« Return to AP090 homepage](/)

Designated `AP090(1)`, this subcommittee focuses on the practical challenges and practices for implementing modern data infrastructure and governance within transit agencies.

## Mission

The subcommittee's mission is to **help bridge the gap on a practical level between cutting-edge data infrastructure and governance practices and where transit agencies large and small are today**.

Most broadly, to do this we:

- **Convene** people who are doing this sort of work or want to be
- **Curate** a knowledge repository that inventories and highlights relevant tools and practices
- **Cultivate** spaces for industry-wide peer support and collaborative projects or research against shared challenges

More specific activites and projects will be discussed at the upcoming TRB Annual Meeting and then open to further discussion online for those who are unable to attend.

### Volunteer roles

We are looking to recruit two volunteers to pair on each of the following areas

- Best-practice interviews

### APTA sub-working group

This TRB subcommittee collaborates closely with the APTA sub-working group on Data Standards and Utilization. Where TRB committees and subcommittees focus on research and convening, this APTA sub-working group is charged with publishing guideline and best practice documents. Through these two groups' collaboration, we can continually assess the state of the industry and current practices and develop materials to help agencies move forward efficiently.
