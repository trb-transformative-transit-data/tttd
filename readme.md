# TRB Standing Committee on Transit Data - TRB AP090

This website hosts the TRB Standing Committee on Transit Data.

## Why GitHub?

It's a clever way of managing code, and a website is just a bunch of code

## Testing locally

While working on the website locally on your computer, it can be helpful to preview what your changes will look like before pushing them up to GitHub.

Assuming you already have [Ruby installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), the short of it is:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

GitHub offers a more comprehensive guide if you have trouble with the above: [Testing your Github Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
