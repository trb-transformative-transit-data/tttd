The TRB Standing Committee on Transit Data focuses on the generation, processing, and emerging opportunities for integrating existing and emerging transit data streams with other transit and transit-related datasets to strengthen the entire network of information.

## Mission

Inform decision making throughout the transit industry with use of key data and by way of knowledge sharing, collaboration and coordination, advocacy for data standards, sponsorship of research, documentation of best practices, and use of open-source methodologies, innovative approaches and tools that provide necessary interfaces for intermodal linked trips.

## Goals and Strategies

- Document transit data sources (AVL, AFC, GTFS, Surveys, travel demand model outputs, Internet of Things, Location-based Services), tools (Databases, GIS, emerging data science tools, stats packages, BI tools, GTFS-RT Location and Occupancy models), research topics, and data governance issues
- Document barriers to acquiring, interfacing, and using data
- Identify, establish, and maintain connections to collaborate on achieving the mission; especially with other relevant TRB committees and external organizations; help organize webinars and workshops
- Create and maintain a membership path to increase competency in developing and using transit data
- Develop calls for research in meetings and small group chats
